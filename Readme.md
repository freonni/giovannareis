## Giovanna Reis

This is a personal ongoing project that I started in order to put in practice my studies on web development.

The technologies used in this project include Javascript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and Sass.

Giovanna dos Reis is a friend and an amazing visual artist based in Bel√©m, PA - Brasil.
